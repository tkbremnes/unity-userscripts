# Ubuntu Unity Userscripts

Integrates the websites I frequent into the Unity web-app interface in Ubuntu. For now only tested in Firefox
(as I have yet to make the Chromium integration work properly).

## How to install

1. Make sure you have [Greasemonkey]() installed.
2. Download the script into the folder of your choice.
3. Drag the file into the Firefox window.
4. Make a cup of tea
5. Listen to music, controllable from the sound menu


## Bandcamp
Controls the music played from the most excellent Bandcamp website.

### Issues
* Does not work on singles yet, only albums
* Does not work on custom domains, only on `*.bandcamp.com/*
